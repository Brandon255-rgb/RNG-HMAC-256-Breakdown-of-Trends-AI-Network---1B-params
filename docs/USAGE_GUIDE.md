# 🎯 ULTIMATE STAKE PREDICTOR - USAGE GUIDE

## 🚀 What This Does

This system combines **4 powerful prediction methods** to give you the most accurate Stake dice predictions possible:

1. **🔑 Hash-Based Prediction** - When you know client/server seeds (100% accurate)
2. **🧠 AI Pattern Detection** - Advanced neural network trained on millions of rolls
3. **🔧 V8 Mathematical Prediction** - Breaks JavaScript random number generation
4. **📈 Real-Time Pattern Analysis** - Learns from your screen observations

## 🎮 How To Use

### Method 1: Quick Start (Recommended)
```bash
python ultimate_stake_predictor.py
# Choose option 1 (Interactive mode)
```

### Method 2: Train First (Maximum Accuracy)
```bash
python ultimate_stake_predictor.py
# Choose option 2 (Train with 100,000+ rolls first)
```

## 📋 Interactive Commands

Once in interactive mode, use these commands:

### Add Observations
```
> observe 45.2
> observe 67.8
> observe 23.1
```

### Get Predictions
```
> predict
> predict 10    # Get 10 predictions
```

### Use Known Seeds (Most Accurate)
```
> seeds client_seed server_seed 1234
> seeds my_client my_server 1000 5    # 5 predictions
```

### Analyze Patterns
```
> analyze    # Shows trends, autocorrelation, streaks
```

### Train System
```
> train 50000    # Train with 50,000 rolls
```

## 🎯 Prediction Output Example

```
🌟 ULTIMATE ENSEMBLE PREDICTION
🎯 #1: 67.3 - 🟢 VERY HIGH [hash+ai+v8+pattern]
🎯 #2: 23.8 - 🟢 HIGH [ai+pattern]
🎯 #3: 89.1 - 🟡 MEDIUM [hash+pattern]

💎 ULTIMATE BETTING STRATEGY
🔥 PRIORITY BETS (2 high confidence):
   Round 1: 67.3 [hash+ai+v8+pattern]
      💡 Range bet 59-75
   Round 2: 23.8 [ai+pattern]
      💡 Strong Under 25 bet
```

## 🔥 Best Practices

### 1. For Maximum Accuracy
- **Use known seeds** when possible (hash method = 100% accurate)
- **Train the AI** with massive datasets first
- **Feed recent observations** from your screen

### 2. Data Collection
- Enter at least **20-30 observations** before predicting
- Update observations **in real-time** as you see results
- The more data, the better the predictions

### 3. Confidence Levels
- **🟢 HIGH/VERY HIGH**: Safe to bet with higher stakes
- **🟡 MEDIUM**: Conservative betting recommended  
- **🔴 LOW**: Wait for more data or skip

## 📊 Training the AI

For maximum accuracy, train the AI first:

```bash
# Generate 1 million training rolls
python massive_stake_analyzer.py
# Choose option 1: Generate massive dataset
# Choose option 2: Train AI on massive data
```

This creates a neural network that can detect subtle patterns humans miss.

## 🎰 Real-World Usage

### Scenario 1: Known Seeds
If you know the client and server seeds:
```
> seeds your_client_seed server_seed_here 1234
```
This gives **100% accurate predictions** for that seed combination.

### Scenario 2: Live Observation
While watching Stake dice results:
```
> observe 45.2
> observe 67.8
> observe 23.1
...continue adding results...
> predict 5
```

### Scenario 3: Hybrid Approach
Combine observations with seed knowledge:
```
> observe 45.2
> observe 67.8
> seeds estimated_client estimated_server 1000
> predict 10
```

## 🧠 AI Model Features

The AI uses cutting-edge 2024-2025 research:
- **Hard Attention** for precise focus
- **Patch Processing** for pattern chunks  
- **Grouped Query Attention** for efficiency
- **Memory Tokens** for long-term patterns
- **Fourier Attention** for frequency analysis

## ⚡ Performance Tips

1. **CPU vs GPU**: Automatically uses GPU if available
2. **Memory**: Can handle millions of data points
3. **Speed**: Real-time predictions in milliseconds
4. **Accuracy**: Ensemble approach maximizes precision

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### "No model loaded"
```bash
python ultimate_stake_predictor.py
# Choose option 2 to train first
```

### "Need more observations"
Add at least 10-20 recent results before predicting.

### Import errors
```bash
pip install torch numpy scipy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn z3-solver
```

## 🚨 Important Notes

- **For Educational Use**: This demonstrates advanced pattern analysis
- **No Guarantees**: Past patterns don't guarantee future results
- **Use Responsibly**: Only bet what you can afford to lose
- **Legal Compliance**: Ensure compliance with local gambling laws
